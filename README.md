The problem:


Most of the new members find problems adapting to the GitCoin and some of them leave for this reason
or do not interact with the community. 




Idea:

After the first registration of the member there is a special page for him in the Gitcoin with simple stages
explaining to him in general the structure of the Gitcoin and its objectives....
After that, you can add some questions to answer that (If he passes the stages successfully, you can send him kudos or Tips...)  


Result (In summary) : 

- The new member will be able to launchand to adapt quickly to what the Gitcoin wants.
- Inderstand the origin story of Gitcoin
- it will limit the repeated registrations of the members*, espacially if this page (idea) placed before the registration 
is confirmed.

Note : 

this idea is a summary of what i think can be really useful On GitCoin for Attract and keep active members(new) for increase 
mission and Result of GitCoin.
